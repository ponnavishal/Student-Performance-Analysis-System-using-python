The "Student Performance Analysis System" is a comprehensive Python project designed to provide
educational institutions with a powerful tool for generating detailed reports that offer an insightful
overview of student performance. This system aims to streamline the process of assessing academic
achievements, enabling educators, administrators, and parents to make data-driven decisions to enhance
the learning experience.In today's dynamic educational landscape, it is crucial for institutions to have
efficient mechanisms for evaluating student progress and identifying areas that may require attention. This project addresses this need by automating the analysis of student performance data, allowing for the
creation of reports that go beyond simple grade summaries. The system calculates averages, identifies
highest and lowest grades, and provides a clear distribution of grades across various subjects and classes.
